###Bio

I am currently a Data Science Research Specialist with the State of California Department of Health Care Services, reporting on the progress of Medi-Cal and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The core of what I do is finding new ways to answer previously un-answerable questions when it comes to the Medi-Cal population of California. I use tools such as SAS server, Teradata, Python, SQL, Octave and am currently studying supvervised Machine Learning models to classify populations using existing data.

I am interested in opportunities to explore and visualize new data sets, especially pertaining to Open Data, Health Care, Government Technology and Civic Innovation.  Please feel free to e-mail requests to collaborate or for article opportunities!
