### Bio 

![hs](/assets/hs.jpg){:height="50px" width="50px"}

I am currently a Data Science Research Specialist with the State of California Department of Health Care Services, reporting on the progress of Medi-Cal and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The core of what I do is finding new ways to answer previously un-answerable questions regarding the Medi-Cal population of California using tools such as SAS server, Teradata, Python and SQL. I am currently studying supvervised Machine Learning models using Octave, to classify populations using existing Medi-Cal data.

I am interested in opportunities to explore and visualize new data sets, especially pertaining to Open Data, Health Care, Government Technology and Civic Innovation.  Please feel free to e-mail requests to collaborate or for article opportunities!
