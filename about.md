![hs](/assets/hs.jpg){:height="50px" width="50px"}

#### **Current Role**

I am currently the:

**Open Data & Data Science Lead** with

**CA Dept of Technology's Office of Digital Innovation**

A fancy way of saying I love opening data and finding ways we can apply Data Science to make California better! More to come on this soon..!

**Project List**

* [CA Open Data Portal (open source DKAN) Launch](http://data.ca.gov)
* OSI EBT ATM Finder, via batch geocoding API

#### **Past Roles**

In the past (2014-2016) I have been a Data Science Research Specialist with the State of California Department of Health Care Services, reporting on the progress of Medi-Cal and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The core of what I did was finding new ways to answer previously un-answerable questions regarding the Medi-Cal population of California using tools such as SAS server, Teradata, Python and SQL. I studied supvervised Machine Learning models using Octave, to classify populations using existing Medi-Cal data.

#### **Contact**

I am interested in opportunities to explore and visualize new data sets, especially pertaining to Open Data, Health Care, Government Technology and Civic Innovation.  Please feel free to e-mail requests to collaborate or for article opportunities!
