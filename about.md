### Bio 

![hs](/assets/hs.jpg){:height="50px" width="50px"}

#### Current

I am currently the CA Open Data & Data Science lead with CA Dept of Technology's Office of Digital Innovation; a fancy way of saying I love opening data and finding ways we can apply Data Science make California better! More to come on this soon..!

#### Past Roles

In the past (2014-2016) I have been a Data Science Research Specialist with the State of California Department of Health Care Services, reporting on the progress of Medi-Cal and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The core of what I did was finding new ways to answer previously un-answerable questions regarding the Medi-Cal population of California using tools such as SAS server, Teradata, Python and SQL. I studied supvervised Machine Learning models using Octave, to classify populations using existing Medi-Cal data.

#### Contact
