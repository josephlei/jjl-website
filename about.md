###Bio

I am currently a Data Science Research Analyst with the State of California Department of Health Care Services, reporting on the progress of Medi-Cal and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  

I am very interested in opportunities to explore and visualize new data sets, especially pertaining to Open Data, Health Care, Government Technology and Civic Innovation.  Please feel free to e-mail requests to collaborate or for article opportunities!
