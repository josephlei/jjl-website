###Information Overload

As someone who strives to continue learning everyday, living in the 21st century is both a blessing and a curse. At no time in history has information and education been more accessible through open courseware, massive open online courses (MOOCs) and the proliferation of the internet. 

However, as many of us know.. this isn't always a good thing. How do I decide what is the most important skill to learn, how do I evaluate the highest "net present value" of time spent and also the big question, does it make more sense to get good at one skill at a time (specialist) or try to learn two or three skills at a time (generalist).

These challenges are compounded when you consider what a potential employer or future employer might or might not value. While Google definitely values hard technical skills, being the world's absolute best developer without Googliness or a spirit of innovation might not lead to a positive outcome.

Very importantly, I have to often remind myself to consider the bigger picture of life, happiness, balance, relaxation and family. We are human, we can only push ourselves so hard.. that may mean that on this side of eternity we may not get to where we think we want to be, but how often have we found ourselves finally "there," just to realize that "there" is nowhere at all.
