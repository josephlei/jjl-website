###Information Overload

As someone who strives to continue learning everyday, living in the 21st century is both a blessing and a curse. At no time in history has information and education been more accessible through open courseware, massive open online courses (MOOCs) and the proliferation of the internet. 

However, as many of us know.. this isn't always a good thing. How do I decide what is the most important skill to learn, how do I evaluate the highest "net present value" of time spent and also the big question, does it make more sense to get good at one skill at a time (specialist) or try to learn two or three skills at a time (generalist).

These challenges are compounded when you consider what a potential employer or future employer might or might not value. While Google definitely values hard technical skills, being the world's absolute best developer without Googliness or a spirit of innovation might not lead to a positive outcome.

Very importantly, I have to often remind myself to consider the bigger picture of life, happiness, balance, relaxation and family. We are human, we can only push ourselves so hard.. that may mean that on this side of eternity we may not get to where we think we want to be, but how often have we found ourselves finally "there," just to realize that "there" is nowhere at all.

####*With that said, here's what I'm currently learning in no particular order :)*

####**Updated 2015-08-27**
#####Personal note: I've moved a lot of items that were here to "Lower Priority Items," not because they're not important, but because I'm learning more about how I learn and trying to be honest with myself about what will make the biggest difference, beautifully referred to as "highest net present value" by Nir Kaldero of Galvanize Data Science.  On second thought, this is the crux of this entire article "what to learn first."

* Python 2.7
* Python libraries: Pandas, Numpy, re (regex)
* VIM
* Descriptive/Inferential Statistics
* Linear Algebra

####*Lower Priority Items*

* HTML parsing: Scrapy, Beautiful Soup 4
* Regex (AND overcoming Red Green color blindness in one step! edit: accomplished via cURL and modifying .CSS)
* CRONtab/launchd scheduling via remote SSH server (currently Digital Ocean on Ubuntu 14.04)
* pList for preferences
* Docker/boot to Docker
* cURL + GET vs. POST* .SH scripts ~/dir path operations
* Python decorators and comprehentions
* Virtual Env/conda env
* Python web frameworks: Django/Flask/Bottle/webapp2
* Leaflet
* Front end, UI/UX
* PGP encryption, GPG command line, verify hash
* MongoDB, SQL Lite
* Python Sci-kit learn, Bokeh Visualization
* Pentaho for open data visualization
* Cassandra
* Apache Spark
* Scala
* Cluster visualization + algorithms, KNN, rForest (via Gephi or other)
* Basic RSS feed concepts, what is the object notation/machine readable schema?
* Tamper Monkey for chrome, grease monkey for firefox? (sp?)
* Ohana API

####*Completed Items*

* SQL Set Operators (vertical table joins)
* SAS Advanced Certification (yay!)
* SAS LAGn(arg) and DIFn(arg) (syntax may be wrong)
