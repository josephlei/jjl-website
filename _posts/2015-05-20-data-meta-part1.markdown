### Data Presentation for Code for Sacramento

Data is an integral part of every business, society and encompasses every action we take as humans, even including the measurement of the pressure on keyboard key(s) as I type this, or the frequency of keystrokes.

As part of the Code for Sacramento team, I had volunteered back in March to arrange for a speaker or to present for this particular week's meetup series.  With the date quickly approaching I opted to present on what I know best, my beloved data.  

At first I was thinking about what people would want to hear or what would be most useful.  Realizing that most people work with data every day, I was slightly intimidated and wondered what I could offer.  However, as I began to write on data beginning with "what is data?" the topic opened itself up, and when originally I was worried about not having enough content, I ended up with a roughly 30 minute presentation touching on general points of interest.  

My exhortation to anyone in the same position I was preparing for this presentation is that what you know matters, even if 90% of the audience knows it.. the effort you went through to prepare for it, to practice speaking in public, nobody can take that away.
