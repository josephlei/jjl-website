### I've been eating at Del Taco for a hwhile now (not a typo)

#### In addition to being dirt cheap, I'm convinced it's one of the healthier fast food places to eat; kind of the mexican version of Panda Express?  Like, if I were homeless.. I'd make sure to be homeless near a Del Taco kind of thing; here are some of my favorite tips/secret menu items.

* You can add onions, fresh cilantro and extra lettuce to anything you order, for free. I didn't even know they had cilantro until a month ago..

* Use the magical phrase "go bold" and for $0.39 extra Del Taco employees will add a decent amount of french fries and special sauce to anything you want (and I do mean **anything**: tacos, burritos, soda, milkshake). When applied to turning the $1.00 half pound bean and cheese burrito into full on meal, it is affectionately termed the "stoner burrito"

* Most company owned Del Tacos (you can usually tell because they are managed very well, clean, friendly, etc.) will accept expired coupons within reason. While I'm not an advocate of always using expired coupons, my take is that coupons are designed to drive sales; accepting an expired coupon demonstrates that employees understand the big picture and generates goodwill for an organization :)

* Order fries with no salt. At Del Taco I genuinely prefer them without salt.. the added upside, they'll make them fresh (also works at other fast food restaraunts).

* Every year without fail, Del Taco does Black Friday/Cyber Monday specials on their gift cards where they give a certain number of free combo meals depending on the amount you buy. The best deal is usually on $100 increments (8 meals, $56 value), so for the past x years I usually buy $100 of gift card, eat the free combo meals from Dec-Feb of the following year, then spend the $100 gift card for the rest of the year. This is a super pro-tip because since it's a gift card, it can be combined with regular BOGO coupons or other specials. In days of future past, Del Taco used to give away other goodies.. unfortunately they no longer give out Del Taco themed beer pong sets, beanies or frisbees :'(

### Other Del Taco factoids

* They do the majority of their prep and cooking fresh in store:
  * Cheddar comes in blocks, shredded in store
  * Tomatoes sliced from whole, then put into a cube cutter press
  * Beans cooked from dry state
  * Advocado sliced from whole
* As far as I know, the following comes out of a bag:
  * Fries
  * Lettuce
  * Chicken (comes frozen, pre-seasoned, grilled in store)
* Stuff I'm not sure about:
  * Ground beef
  * Burger ingredients (have never had a burger at Del Taco before)
