#### Why word clouds? Why now? Why this portal?

I like word clouds, no.. not becuase they are fluffy and make you think about life, but because like other forms of visualization they provide a more direct link to what the data is "saying."  However this come with the natural caveats of data limitations and interpretation.  In this instance, I chose to examine all the meta data from the California Health and Human Services Open Data Portal, a SOCRATA platform to see what other teams in sister departments were posting; the idea was that this indirectly indicates what these departments view to be of interest to the general public or were datasets that were commonly requested in Public Records Act requests.
