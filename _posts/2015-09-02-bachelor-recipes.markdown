###There are certain recipes a bachelor comes to know.. secrets rarely shared outside the inner circle.. read on brave sojourner..

####**Updated 2015-09-01**

#### How to make a *real* steak (assuming one serving, maybe two.. if you're making more than that, you don't need my advice ;)

1. If you're not grilling it, cast iron only.. no exceptions
2. Season with salt + pepper only, extra points for course versions of either/both
3. Let steak warm up to room temperature, covered on the counter
4. Add a tiny amount of oil (1-2 tbsp per 8 oz) to cast iron
5. Heat cast iron for 4-8 minutes on medium high heat until *literally* smoking hot
6. Add steak(s), don't move it.. cook for 2-3 minutes per side if under 1" thickness, adjust accordingly for "thickness"
 * caveat: if I ruled the world, a "real" steak would moo.. but to each.. their own
7. Remove, plate, cover
8. Add x oz of sliced mushrooms and onions to aforementioned blazing hot cast iron skillet, season with a pat of butter and some cooking wine
9. Profit
