###There are certain recipes a bachelor comes to know.. secrets rarely shared.. read on brave sojourner..

####**Updated 2015-09-21**

####**How to make steak** (assuming one serving, maybe two.. if you're making more than that, you don't need my advice)

1. If you're not grilling it, use cast iron.. 
2. Season with just salt + pepper, course versions of both if you can spare it
3. Let steak warm up to room temperature, covered.. this step is super important
4. Add ~1.25 tbsp of oil per 8 oz to cast iron
5. Heat cast iron for 4-8 minutes on medium high heat until *literally* smoking hot
6. Add steak(s), don't move it.. cook for 2-3 minutes per side if under 1" thickness, adjust accordingly for "thickness"
7. Remove, plate, cover
8. Add x oz of thickly sliced mushrooms and onions to aforementioned blazing hot cast iron skillet, season with a pat of butter and some cooking wine
9. Plate
10. Profit

####**Chili-mac for the rest of us** (except without the mac)

1. One can Hormel hot chili (with beans)
2. One package Uncle Ben's rice
3. One generous sprinkle shredded *sharp* cheddar cheese
4. One portion hot sauce of your choice
5. One microwave
6. TWO AWESOME, DELICIOUS, FILLING MEALS

####**Ramen for the 21st century**

1. One shin-ramen cup (the spicy korean kind)
2. Add one slice or half cup shredded sharp chedder
3. Resist the urge to not add one slice or half cup shredded sharp chedder
4. Add boiling hot water, cover lid
5. Eat and reflect on how you could have never thought of this strange yet tasty combination before
6. Shoutout to Marvin C. for this one
