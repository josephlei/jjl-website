###There are certain recipes a bachelor comes to know.. secrets rarely shared outside the inner circle.. read on brave sojourner..

####**Updated 2015-09-01**

####How to make a *real* steak (assuming one serving, maybe two.. if you're making more than that, you don't need my advice ;)

1. If you're not grilling it, cast iron only.. no exceptions
2. Season with salt + pepper only, extra points for course versions of either/both
3. Let steak warm up to room temperature, covered on the counter
4. Add a tiny amount of oil (1-2 tbsp per 8 oz) to cast iron
5. Heat cast iron for 4-8 minutes on medium high heat until *literally* smoking hot
6. Add steak(s), don't move it.. cook for 2-3 minutes per side if under 1" thickness, adjust accordingly for "thickness"
 * caveat: if I ruled the world, a "real" steak would moo.. but to each.. their own
7. Remove, cover
8. Add x oz of sliced mushrooms and onions to aforementioned blazing hot cast iron skillet, season with a pat of butter and some cooking wine
9. Plate
10. Profit

####Chili-mac for the rest of us (except without the mac)

1. One can Hormel hot chili (with beans)
2. One package uncle bens ready rice (any flavor, chicken is always good)
3. One generous sprinkle shredded sharp cheddar cheese
4. One portion hot sauce of your choice
5. One microwave
6. TWO AWESOME, DELICIOUS, FILLING MEALS

####Ramen for the 21st century

1. One shin-ramen cup (the spicy korean kind)
2. Add one slice or half cup shredded sharp chedder
3. Resist the urge to not add one slice or half cup shredded sharp chedder
4. Add boiling hot water, cover lid
5. Open lid one minute before recommend time for more "al dente" noodle
6. Eat and marvel at how you could have never thought of this combination before

####Martinis

1. While not technically a food group, an integral part of a Ron Swanson man's repetoire
2. May be subject to interpretation and criticism.. my personal preference, assuming the barkeep knows a martini *should* be **ice cold**:
  * Vodka Martini
  * Up
  * With a twist
