### "A culture of Accountability"

##### Today I was given the opportunity to visit a meeting of San Francisco's Department of Public Works 'STAT' management program, courtesy of Principal Administrative Analyst *Alexandra B.* In brief, it is described as a 'performance management program that enables Public Works leadership and staff to work together to **monitor and improve the performance of core operational activities.**'

##### Upon walking in I was greeted with a table containing packets with titles such as "Street Use & Mapping" and "BSES Street Cleaning" as well as eight wall mounted monitors displaying charts and graphs of all types. After a brief introduction and welcome to guests including myself, the meeting started underway facilitated by none other than Director Mohammed Nuru himself.
