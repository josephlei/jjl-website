### "A Culture of Accountability"
***

&nbsp;

Today I was given the opportunity to visit a meeting of San Francisco's Department of Public Works 'STAT' management program, courtesy of Principal Administrative Analyst *Alexandra B.* In brief, it is described as:

> "A performance management program that enables Public Works leadership and staff to work together to **monitor and improve the performance of core operational activities.**"

#### Upon walking in I was greeted with a table of packets with titles such as "Street Use & Mapping" and "BSES Street Cleaning" as well as eight monitors displaying charts and graphs of all types. After a brief introduction and welcome to guests including myself, the meeting started underway facilitated by none other than Director Mohammed Nuru himself. 

Different departmental managers *<u>and their staff leads</u>* presented the recent results of operational activities, explaining outliers and trends affected by special events or staffing disruptions. Being newly introduced to Public Works activities it was maybe more difficult to understand the nuances of what the charts, graphs and maps were presenting; however I was encouraged and surprised at the efficiency with which data was being presented. 

With vital information "encapsulated" into an easy to understand visual, Director Nuru being intimately familiar with the subject matter quickly keyed on important points. As a group they discussed poignant questions, enabling the quick re-adjust of resources to target specific opportunities such as one specific abused trash bin next to a Safeway supermarket.
