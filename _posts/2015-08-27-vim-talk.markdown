###Takeaways from Ben Orenstein's talk on expert level VIM

####**Updated 2015-09-02**

Ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkdrYWhh-8s

* You need to be "obnoxiously intolerant of typing" (TL;DR - **demand** a 1 keystroke solution over 2)
* Focus on the things you do frequently, maximize value for effort
 * Solution: map something (ex. ctrl+s) to replace esc+shift+colon+w
 * Leader commands, binding short mappings to longer commands
 * Infrequent operations, but slow operations
 * Map typos you do all the time, ex. git psuh instead of git push, make it do the same thing
* Have a cheat sheet, 7 +/- 2 commands, train it
 * if you see you're not using it, remove it
 * once it's in your brain, remove it
* VIM rc config file
* Use the help (:h)
* cmd + T (fuzzy finder matcher), apparently it's awesome, don't know how to use it yet
* direct seek/jump to a numbered line, do something like `14+G` (14 + shift + g) jumps you to line 14
* learn motions (nouns) cmd (verbs)

###Actions Taken

* bash_profile
 * `alias gis = 'git status'` potential future conflict w/carto tools, worry about it when i get there
 * `alias lal = 'ls -al'`
 * `alias art = 'cd \jjl_website\_posts'` i.e. universal "take me to my repo for website articles" (art = "articles" abbrev.)
