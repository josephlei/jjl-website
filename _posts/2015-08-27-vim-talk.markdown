###Takeaways from Ben Orenstein's talk on expert VIM

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkdrYWhh-8s

* You need to be "obnoxiously intolerant of typing" (TL;DR - demand a one keystroke solution over two keystrokes)
* Focus on the things you do frequently
 * Solution: map something (ex. ctrl+s) to replace esc+shift+colon+w
 * Leader commands, binding short mappings to longer commands
 * Infrequent operations, but slow operations
 * Map typos you do all the time, ex. git psuh instead of git push, make it do the same thing
* Have a cheat sheet, 7 +/- 2 commands, train it
 * if you see you're not using it, remove it
 * once it's in your brain, remove it
* VIM rc config file
* Use the help (:h)
* cmd + T (fuzzy finder matcher)
* 14 G (14 + shift + g) jumps you to line 14
* learn motions (nouns) cmd (verbs)

###Actions Taken

* bash_profile
 * `alias gis = 'git status'` potential future conflict w/carto tools, worry about it when i get there
