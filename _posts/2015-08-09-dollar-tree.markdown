##Dollar Tree Shenanigans

##What to stock, what to skip

Let me just say, I love dollar stores.. not just because of the jankiness that sometimes comes with em' but because there are truly amazing people who work there.. who just happen to provide me great bargains.

With that said, not all items are created equal in the wonderful world of said greenback; some items you should stock.. others, definitely skip

Shoutout to my local dollar store peepz: Armando, Alex

##Stock

**Batteries** - since I've been knee high to a duck and old enough to know what batteries were, I never understood why they cost so dang much.  I get why specialty batteries and critical appliction power cells are pricey, but what in the world $2 to power my remote control? yeah no.. here eight AAA, eight AA or 2 nine-volt batteries are just a single solitary buckaroo, perfect for low drain devices such as a computer mouse, mini flashlight or a tv/stereo remote

**The Sunday Paper** - you might be wondering why anybody would go to the dollar store for the Sunday paper.. oh yeah, it's only $1.  In my local Sacramento region the Sunday Sacramento Bee is $2 anywhere else; in fact, at $1 it's cheaper here than buying it directly from the newspaper itself.  p.s. buy 3 copies, the coupons more than pay for themselves

**Cheapo Dial Soap** - most people that I know nowadays don't use bar soap.. but I'm not one of those people I know, I'm uh.. just me.. a.. bar soap user.. Actually, the reason this is on the list of things to stock is because often there is a online printable coupon for $2 off when you buy 2 multipacks of dial; which makes it basically free, awesome.  I use the soap myself and on days like today where I brought home twelve bars of soap for a paltry $0.16 (tax) I donate the rest to a local charity or shelter.

**Farmer John Classic Sausage and Sausage Breakfast Links** - this ones pretty easy.. Sunday paper commonly has a $1 off coupon for these items, take home some sausage for FREE!  This time since it's a food item and theres no tax on food, it's literally free

**Mini Bottle of Goo Gone** - They don't always have it in stock, but it's 50% cheaper than most places that sell it for $2

**Frozen Spring Rolls** - They are seriously delicious, and they come in a TEN PACK

**Progresso Classic Vegetable Soup** - Normally $1.79+ at the grocery store

**Super thin paper plates** - 40 plates for $1, I use em' to cover food in the microwave, then re-use them as food prep plates or coasters

**Cylindrical Mailing Tubes** - $3+ elsewhere

**Other items that are just a great deal (self explanatory)**

* Cream/sugar/condiment pourers (like the ones at coffee shops or pizza places)
* Two pack fly swatters
* Campbells double noodle chicken noodle soup
* Corned beef hash
* Bounty single roll (-$0.50 coupon), not the best quality but does the job for simple tasks


##Skip

**Frozen Steak** - I thought the whole idea of buying a frozen steak from the dollar store a bit strange, but curiosity got the best of me.  While the steak itself was quite tasty and cooked up in about 30 seconds due to it's thicknes, the packaging reveals that it contains a LOT (maybe 20-30%) of so called flavor enhancing "solution."  Geeky me did some math and it turns out these steaks are over $6 per pound.  At that kind of price, I can get fresh chuck steak from the supermarket next door :)

**Water** - 6 half liter bottles for $1 means a 24 pack is $4; most places have 24 packs for <$2.50

**Wet Wipes** - 20 wipes for $1 vs. Wal-Mart 90 wipes for $0.94

**Dry Erase Markers** - They suck, stick with Expo

**Hot dog cutter** - Thought it was novel at the time, never used it except that one time..

**Electrical tape** - It might be just me but I think the adhesive expires and turns into a gooey mess way too soon after I bought it

##Merh (items I'm still on the fence about)

**Broom and Dustpan** - sold as two separate items, they are cheaper than you can buy elsewhere.. but they're nothing to write home about in terms of performane and build quality (the dustpan comes apart for easy storage, but this makes it a little flimsy during normal use)

**Frozen Clam Strips** - 3.5 oz of breaded clam strips.. they're decently tasty and cheap, but just not quite as good as the premium store brand names like Trident seafood (about $3 for a slightly larger portion)

**Straws/Napkins** - Merh, I usually bring back extra napkins and maybe an unused straw from starbucks/fast food but it's nice just having a literal gripton of straws and not having to think about it

**Masking tape* - It's cheap enough, but the quality is lacking.. good enough for simple jobs sticking up stuff and not leaving a residue, but I definitely wouldn't paint with it.

**Nail file** - I use it for taking off rough nail edges after clipping.  They don't last very long but the upside is when they're no good anymore you can just cut out a piece of 220 grit sandpaper, glue it on and you're good to go again

**Isopropyl alcohol** - It's either low concentration (~30%) or a really small bottle (maybe 8oz), would probably want to be more safe than sorry if using it to disinfect stuff
