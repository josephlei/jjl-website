###Dollar Tree Shenanigans

####What to stock, what to skip

Let me just say, I love dollar stores.. not just because of the jankiness that sometimes comes with em' but because there are truly amazing people who work there.. who just happen to provide me great bargains.

With that said, not all items are created equal in the wonderful world of said greenback; some items you should stock.. others, definitely skip

####Stock

**Batteries** - since I've been knee high to a duck and old enough to know what batteries were, I never understood why they cost so dang much.  I get why specialty batteries and critical appliction power cells are pricey, but what in the world $2 to power my remote control? yeah no.. here eight AAA, eight AA or 2 nine-volt batteries are just a single solitary buckaroo, perfect for low drain devices such as a computer mouse, mini flashlight or a tv/stereo remote

**The Sunday Paper** - you might be wondering why anybody would go to the dollar store for the Sunday paper.. oh yeah, it's only $1.  In my local Sacramento region the Sacramento Bee is $2 on Sundays anywhere else; in fact, at $1 it's cheaper here than buying it directly from the newspaper itself

**Cheapo Dial Soap** - most people that I know nowadays don't use bar soap.. but I'm not one of those people I know, I'm uh.. just me.. a.. bar soap user.. Actually, the reason this is on the list of things to stock is because often there is a online printable coupon for $2 off when you buy 2 multipacks of dial; which makes it basically free, awesome.  I use the soap myself and on days like today where I brought home twelve bars of soap for a paltry $0.16 (tax) I donate the rest to a local charity or shelter.

**Farmer John Classic Sausage and Sausage Breakfast Links** - this ones pretty easy.. Sunday paper commonly has a $1 off coupon for these items, take home some sausage for FREE!  This time since it's a food item and theres no tax on food, it's literally free

**Mini Bottle of Goo Gone** - They don't always have it in stock, but it's 50% cheaper than most places that sell it for $2

**Frozen Spring Rolls** - They are seriously delicious, and they come in a TEN PACK

**Other items that are just a great deal (self explanatory)**
* 30 press and seal envelopes
* Cream/sugar/condiment pourers (like the ones at coffee shops or pizza places)


####Skip

**Frozen Steak** - I thought the whole idea of buying a frozen steak from the dollar store a bit strange, but curiosity got the best of me.  While the steak itself was quite tasty and cooked up in about 30 seconds due to it's thicknes, the packaging reveals that it contains a LOT (maybe 20-30%) of so called flavor enhancing "solution."  Geeky me did some math and it turns out these steaks are over $6 per pound.  At that kind of price, I can get fresh chuck steak from the supermarket next door :)

**Water** - 6 half liter bottles for $1 means a 24 pack is $4; most places have 24 packs for <$2.50
