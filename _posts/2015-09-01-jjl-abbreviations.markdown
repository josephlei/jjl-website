####**Updated 2015-09-01**

I abbreviate (abrev.) the heck out of almost everything, so in case what I write seems like gibberish.. 

Some of the following might be common sense, but I hope the following legend helps :)

* Dx = data, or dataset(s)
* IDx = input data/dataset(s)
* ODx = output data/dataset(s)
* Δ = delta, changes, modification, etc.
* obj = object
* $ = char = character (old habits from SAS)
* dim = dimension (98% of the time..)
* EOL = end of line
* EOF = end of file
* BOL = beginning of file (I made this one up, but it works)
* Mvar = macro variable
* Ps = proc SQL (SAS specific)
* α = alpha = any lower or uppercase letter a-z or A-Z
