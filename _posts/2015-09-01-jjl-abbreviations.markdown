####**Updated 2015-09-02**

I abbreviate (abrev.) the heck out of almost everything, so in case what I write seems like gibberish.. 

Some of the following might be common sense, but I hope the following legend helps :)

* Dx = data, or dataset(s)
* IDx = input data/dataset(s)
* ODx = output data/dataset(s)
* Δ = delta, change, modification, marginal difference, etc.
* obj = object
* $ = char = character (old habits from SAS)
* dim = dimension (98% of the time..)
* EOL = end of line
* EOF = end of file
* BOL = beginning of file (I made this one up, but it works)
* Mvar = macro variable
* Ps = proc SQL (SAS specific)
* α = alpha = any lower or uppercase letter a-z or A-Z 
* str = string = any combo of characters
* ref = reference
* re = regarding, "subject of conversation" (ex. contact me re: last week's agenda items)
* def = default, occasionally secondary meaning of "define(d)" which will be clear by context
* spec = specify
* specd = specified
* arg = argument
* var = variable
* ssh = secure shell (connection)
* scp = secure copy (native to *NIX systems, Windows req 3rd party client such as winscp, Filezilla, putty, cygwin)
* req(s) = require(s), requirement(s)
* art = articles (blog posts, etc.)
