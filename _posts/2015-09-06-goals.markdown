###Joseph's things he is working on..

####**Updated 2015-09-08**

1. Do one thing a day that you can't lose after it's done, for example.. working out 
2. Be ok with resting.. planned, intentional work is exponentially more powerful
3. Be consistent, obviously one of the hardest things in the world
4. A stiff brush can solve 2/3 of your problems
5.  

More to come, will integrate 10+ after returning to the office :)
