###Joseph's things he is working on..

####**Updated 2015-09-22**

1. Hone a sense of timing
2. Framing, context, audience
3. A certain amount of ambiguity is ok
4. Knowing that the answer exists and where to find it is half the battle, technical implementation is the easy part
5. Build good fences
6. Planned, intentional work is exponentially powerful, rest when needed
7. Be consistent, obviously one of the hardest things in the world
8. A stiff brush can solve 2/3 of your problems
9. Do one thing a day that you can't lose after it's done, for example.. working out
