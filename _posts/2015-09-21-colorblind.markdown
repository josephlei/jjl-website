###The Backstory
I found out I was red/green colorblind sometime in elementary school and never thought much of it.  Being colorblind doesn't mean I can't see the color and totally miss out on things like Christmas; more so it means that I have a hard time telling the two apart when the hues are similar. Until recently, this "disability" didn't really affect me in any significant way except my friends asking me what color something was; I could/can see traffic lights just fine and so on.

###The Challenge
Recently, in my quest for data domination I have made it a goal to learn VIM (a command line text editor) and Regular Expressions (A way of matching string patterns).  In the course of learning regex in particular, I came across a website with great tutorials and was a great way to learn.. **except** the main colors used were, you guessed it.. red, green and blue.
